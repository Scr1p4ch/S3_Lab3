if you 

Page 2:
can keep 
your head 
when all 

Page 3:
about you 
are losing 
theirs and 

Page 4:
blaming it 
on you 
if you 

Page 5:
can trust 
yourself when 
all men 

Page 6:
doubt you 
but make 
allowance for 

Page 7:
their doubting 
too if 
you can 

Page 8:
wait and 
not be 
tired by

waiting or 
being lied

lies or

way to 

Page 12:
hating and 
yet don't 
look too 

Page 13:
good nor 
talk too 
wise if 

Page 14:
you can 
dream and 
not make 

Page 15:
dreams your 
master if 
you can 

Page 16:
think and 
not make 
thoughts your 

Page 17:
aim if 
you can 
meet with 

Page 18:
triumph and 
disaster and 
treat those 

Page 19:
two impostors 
just the 
same if 

Page 20:
you can 
bear to 

Page 21:
hear the 
truth you've 
spoken twisted 

Page 22:
by knaves 
to make 
a trap 

Page 23:
for fools 
or watch 
the things 

Page 24:
you gave 
your life 
to broken 

Page 25:
and stoop 
and build 
them up 

Page 26:
with worn 
out tools 
if you 

Page 27:
can make 
one heap 
of all 

Page 28:
your winnings 
and risk 
it on 

Page 29:
one turn 
of pitch 
and toss 

Page 30:
and lose 
and start 

Page 31:
again at 
your beginnings 
and never 

Page 32:
breathe a 
word about 
your loss 

Page 33:
if you 
can force 
your heart 

Page 34:
and nerve 
and sinew 
to serve 

Page 35:
your turn 
long after 
they are 

Page 36:
gone and 
so hold 
on when 

Page 37:
there is 
nothing in 
you except 

Page 38:
the will 
which says

Page 39:
hold on 
if you 
can talk 

Page 40:
with crowds 
and keep 

Page 41:
your virtue 
or walk 
with kings

neither foes 
nor loving 
friends can 

Page 44:
hurt you 
if all 
men count 

Page 45:
with you 
but none 
too much 

Page 46:
if you 
can fill 
the unforgiving 

Page 47:
minute with 
sixty seconds 
worth of 

Page 48:
distance run 
yours is 
the earth 

Page 49:
and everything 
that's in 
it and
